In order to open testhaptio.mdl, the following condtions are needed:
 i) numdevices variable must be defined (with the current number of 
 haptic interfaces you are using)
 ii) the directory, along with its subfolders, must be in the current Matlab path.
 	If it is not, an quick fix is:
 	>>addpath(genpath(pwd))


NOTES FOR LINUX USERS

The library usb-1.0 needs privileges to access any USB drive, including an
haptic interface. Thus, to make the mex work two solutions are available:
 i) launch matlab with root privileges: $ sudo matlab
 ii) add some rules that allow your user to access the USB


First option is strongly discouraged, but can be used on first instance to
check where mex compilation was successfull and effective works.


For second option following steps are required:

1) Run $ lsusb and determine your haptic interface identifiels, in my case:
	Bus 002 Device 006: ID 0403:cb48 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd

2) cd /etc/udev/rules.d/ and add a new file called 71-usb-haptic-interface.rules.
Beware that such file is to be the last rule, so replace 71 with the maximum 
number among your rules.

3) add the following text into the file:

# USB devices (usbfs replacement)
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403" , ATTRS{idProduct}=="cb48", GROUP="davide", MODE="660"

4) Note that ATTRS{idVendor} and ATTRS{idProduct} must match corresponding data 
of your haptic interface (which you found out with step 1).

5) reboot your system to make your chages effective.
